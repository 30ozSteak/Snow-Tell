Snow And Tell

I decided to spend some of my break rebuilding the site I had done for a fictional snowboarding company/brand, STOMP. I rebuilt the site from the ground up and tried to learn one new CSS trick a day, and find a way to incorporate them into the project. So far, it only works on ... my... browser size.. so don't go crazy resizing stuff.


Why tho?


My biggest goal was to learn some new CSS trick a day. I accomplished this goal, and feel infinitely more confident with CSS now. 
Building an e-commerce site is very likely what I'll be having to do in the future, so I'm getting the practice now. I'll be updating this occasionally with functionality

I also built this original site using Bootstrap and felt like I was cheating, so now I've done it without.
